# Homework 5: Dynamic Memory
## Focus
* Dynamic memory

## Problem:
Building on previous assignments, we will be reading a file of commands to create Nobles and Warriors, and sending them off to battle.

Key differences:

* Each time a warrior or a noble is defined, we will create it on the heap.
* We will keep track of the nobles in a vector of pointers to nobles.
* We will keep track of all warriors using a vector of pointers to warriors.

The input file will be named `"nobleWarriors.txt"`.

### Commands
* Noble. Create a Noble on the heap.
* Warrior. Create a Warrior on the heap.
* Hire. Call the Noble's hire method.
* Fire. Call the Noble's fire method.
* Battle. Call the Noble's battle method.
* Status. The status command shows the nobles, together with their armies, as we did previously. In addition, it will show separately the warriors who do not currentle have a employer
* Clear. Clear out all the nobles and warriors that were created.

Our application is going to rely on each Noble having a unique name and each Warrior having a unique name. Otherwise, how would we be sure who we were hiring (or firing). Note that this is **not** a requirement of the Noble and Warrior classes themselves, just of this particular use of them, i.e. our application.

Whenever you are displaying a Noble or a Warrior, you will use the **output operator** for the class.

### Handle errors!
Previously we promised that all of the commands we gave you the input would be valid. Now we would like you to take some responsibility for checking the input. First, we still guarantee that the **format** of the file will be correct. That means that the Warrior command will always have a name and a strength. The Battle command will always have two names. The Status command will not have any other information on it than just the word Status.

However, you will need to detect and report any issues indicating inconsistencies, such as:

* Noble command: if a Noble with a given name already exists.
* Warrior command:if a Warrior with a given name already exists.
* Hire command: If a Noble tries to hire a Warrior and either of them do not exist.
* Fire command: If a Noble tries to fire a Warrior and either the Noble does not exist or does not have the Warrior by that name in this army.
* Battle command: If a Noble initiates a battle with another Noble, but one or the other does not exist.

We have not specified the format of these error messages, so we'll leave that up to you. (You get to be creative!)

### Example input file (no errors):
```
Noble King_Arthur
Noble Lancelot_du_Lac
Noble Jim
Noble Linus_Torvalds
Noble Bill_Gates
