Reading in a file
How NOT to read a file. The code shows the a common error in writing a loop to read a file. payroll.txt is a sample input file to run the program on. Can you modify the program so that it works properly? Don't change the input file.
Default Arguments
Outline of a menu-driven application
Mixing the input operator and getline
Vectors
Reading a file into a vector
Vector of objects that contain vectors .
String Streams
String stream examples
Pointers
Addresses, pointer variables and pointer arithmetic.
"Association" - spouse pointers.
Reading a file into a vector of pointers to objects on the heap
Class Basics
The simplest class
A simple Date class
A Person with a birthday and a spouse (composition and association)
Vector of objects. How do you fill a vector of objects? Here's a sample input file for the program: cars.txt
Inheritance
Basic Inheritance
Order of Constructors and Destructors using Inheritance
Polymorphism
Abstract Classes
Multiple Inheritance
Separate Compilation / Namespaces
A simple date class using separate compilation: Date.h, Date.cpp and testDate.cpp
Same date class, but with the added feature a its own namespace: Date.h, Date.cpp and testDate.cpp
Operator Overloading
Overloading Operators: Date.h, Date.cpp and testDate.cpp.
Overloading arithmetic operators: Complex.h, Complex.cpp and testComplex.cpp
The start of a vector class: SquareBrackets.cpp
Copy Control and the Big 3
Demonstration of need for copy constructor: testDoNothing.cpp
The big 3 using a vector class: Vector.h, Vector.cpp and testVector.cpp
Dynamic Arrays
"Expanding" a dynamic array
Linked Lists
A simple linked list toolkit with functions for displaying, adding and removing items, and finding the length of the list.
Mostly the same toolkit, however some it uses a Node constructor with default arguments to simplify some of the functions. A few other short cuts are also used. Separate compilation.: Node.h, Node.cpp and testLinkedList.cpp.
Linked list toolkit using a templated Node class: Node.h (will not be covered in Spring 2007)
Recursion
Some recursive functions
Some recursive functions with c-strings
Binary Search
Some linked list toolkit functions using recursion
Two-way recursive functions.
STL
STL
Another STL example. Some overlap with first one.
Templates
A template function: maximum.h
Tempated vector class: Vector.h and a test program testVector.cpp. Notes on how the conversion was done. (not covered)
Exceptions
