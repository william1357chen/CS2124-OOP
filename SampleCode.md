# Code Samples

## Basics of C++
* File I/O
    * Reading in a file
    * How NOT to read a file. The code shows the a common error in writing a loop to read a file. payroll.txt is a sample input file to run the program on. Can you modify the program so that it works properly? Don't change the input file.
* Functions
    * Parameters Passing
    * Default Arguments
* Structs
    * Struct Basics
    * [const methods]()
* Vectors
    * Reading a file into a vector
    * Reading a file into a vector of class objects. How do you fill a vector of objects? Here's a sample input file for the program: cars.txt
    * Vector of objects that contain vectors

## Classes 
* The simplest class
* A simple Date class
* A simple Person Class

## Pointers
* Addresses, pointer variables and pointer arithmetic.
* Pointers with const
* Dynamic arrays on the Heap
* "Expanding" a dynamic array
* Reading a file into a vector of pointers to objects on the heap
## Composition and Association
* A Person with a birthday and a spouse (composition and association)
* "Association" - spouse pointers.

## Copy Control and the Big 3
* Copy Control Basics
* The big 3 using a vector class: Vector.h, Vector.cpp and testVector.cpp
* Inheritance mixed with Copy Control

## Separate Compilation / Namespaces
* A simple date class using separate compilation: 
* Same date class, but with the added feature a its own namespace: Date.h, Date.cpp and testDate.cpp
## Operator Overlaoding 
* Output Operator
* Square Brackets Operator for Vector: SquareBrackets.cpp
* Overloading Operators: Date.h, Date.cpp and testDate.cpp.
* Overloading arithmetic operators: Complex.h, Complex.cpp and testComplex.cpp

## Inheritance 
* Basic Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Abstract Classes
* Multiple Inheritance

## Linked Lists
* A simple linked list toolkit with functions for displaying, adding and removing items, and finding the length of the list.
* Mostly the same toolkit, however some it uses a Node constructor with default arguments to simplify some of the functions. A few other short cuts are also used. Separate compilation.: Node.h, Node.cpp and testLinkedList.cpp.
## Recursion 
* Some recursive functions
* Some linked list toolkit functions using recursion

## STL - Standard Template Library
* STL examples

## Templates
* A template function: maximum.h
* Tempated vector class: Vector.h and a test program testVector.cpp.

## Exceptions and Assertions 
* Exception examples
