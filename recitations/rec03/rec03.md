# Recitation 3 - Classes - encapsulation and data hiding

## Topics
* Classes

The first is a [tutorial](./Rec03.pdf) on the basics of C++'s syntax for using classes.

The second choice is to define a class for the game [Minesweeper](minesweeper.pdf). Please note this is more difficult, for example it involves doing a depth-first search on a two-dimensional grid.

Either choice is fine and earns the same amount of credit. Realistically, all students are more likely to complete the first choice during the lab.
